/**
 * #241: boot-time backfill of synthetic tick_metrics rows across a
 * detected daemon-offline gap.
 *
 * Two problems this solves:
 *
 *   1. Difficulty-retarget markers: a retarget that happened *inside*
 *      the gap has no real tick_metrics row at its canonical time, so
 *      the chart's `prev vs next difficulty > 0.5%` marker detection
 *      finds the diff jump at the *first post-gap real tick*. The
 *      marker lands days late.
 *
 *   2. Pool-luck through the gap: `pool_luck_24h/7d/30d` lives in
 *      tick_metrics. With no rows in the gap, the chart linearly
 *      interpolates the luck line - so the operator sees a flat
 *      mauve segment across the gap even though pool_blocks_backfill
 *      has correctly populated pool blocks in the same window.
 *
 * Approach
 * --------
 *
 * Determine the set of retargets in the gap. With `bitcoindClient`
 * wired, walk back through every retarget height (mod 2016) from
 * chain tip until the block's canonical timestamp is before the gap;
 * each in-gap retarget contributes (canonical_time,
 * canonical_difficulty). Without bitcoindClient, if the pre/post
 * difficulty diff is > 0.5%, derive a single pseudo-retarget at the
 * latest retarget height's nearest-pool-block estimate (legacy
 * pre-bitcoind behavior preserved as a fallback so multi-retarget
 * cases can't be detected, but the most-recent one still surfaces).
 *
 * Then generate a synthetic tick every {@link SYNTHETIC_INTERVAL_MS}
 * across the gap, plus a tick at each retarget timestamp. Assign
 * each tick the difficulty as-of its time (= the difficulty of the
 * most recent retarget at-or-before that time, falling back to
 * prevTick's difficulty for ticks before any in-gap retarget).
 *
 * Bucket alignment (the gotcha)
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * The chart's `/api/metrics` endpoint AVG-aggregates rows into
 * server-side buckets sized per the visible range (5-min raw for
 * 24h, 30-min for 1w, 1h for 1m, 1d for 1y/all). The chart's
 * retarget-marker detector also has a sustained-check filter: a
 * detected diff jump is only accepted if the *next* non-null bucket
 * matches the current within 0.5% (suppresses spurious markers from
 * smoothed bucket transitions). If a bucket contains both pre and
 * post-retarget ticks, its AVG is intermediate, the sustained check
 * fails, and the marker is rejected. Empirical: 5-min synthetic
 * cadence + 30-min 1w bucket = 6 pre-retarget ticks averaged with 1
 * post-retarget canonical tick in the same bucket, AVG mostly
 * pre-retarget, sustained-check fails, marker invisible on the very
 * range the operator is most likely viewing.
 *
 * Fix: skip cadence synthetics whose 30-min bucket collides with
 * any retarget canonical's 30-min bucket. The canonical synthetic
 * is then alone in its 30-min bucket, AVG = newDiff exactly, the
 * adjacent bucket's AVG = prevDiff exactly (no mixed rows), step
 * crosses the 0.5% threshold cleanly and sustains. Works for 1w
 * (30-min) and 1m (1h) views; 1y / All (1d bucket) is too coarse
 * - the bucket containing canonical still mixes pre and post within
 * the day - and is a documented limitation.
 *
 * Idempotency
 * -----------
 *
 * Every run DELETEs `synthetic = 1` rows strictly inside the
 * detected gap before re-inserting. Re-runs replace stale entries
 * instead of accumulating them - and a previous boot's wrong-time
 * synthetic doesn't block re-detection (handled jointly by the
 * `synthetic = 0` filter on gap-boundary queries).
